- generate vim helpfile from grunt doc markdown files
- add completion to `:Grunt`
- detect gruntfile and enable command based on that
- template/snippets for common grunt related file
  - `BufNewFile` grunt.{js|coffee}, gruntfile.{js|coffee}
  - `BufNewFile` */tasks/*
  - snippets/completion for some of the grunt api (file, util, log, etc.) autogenerated would be good.

Detect a grunt project. A simple thing (not as evolved as vim-rails)

Probably by looking up and searching in the app directory for files like: `grunt.{js|coffee]`, `Gruntfile.{js|coffee}`

if there is, add commands and all plugin stuff.

Only one (or very few command) should be made global.

---

path manipulation. `:h path`. So that we can `:find things` super-easily.

* Add ./
* Add tasks/
* Add bin/

---

Command `:Gtask` -> like vim-rails' `:R<command>` family of commands (says :Rcontroller)

Easily jump to a given grunt task (like `:find` only on tasks dirs)

---

Command `:Grunt`. Basic wrapper to `grunt executable` (like vim-rails' `:Rake`)

Use `:!` instead of `system`

Open the quickfix window if there were any errors.

---

Command `:Glint` special purpose grunt lint command.

Open the quickfix window if there were any errors, plus...

Super-handy mapping to jump to the given file, at the given line number (file under cursor)

---

Command `:Gtest` special purpose grunt test command (really similar to `:Glint`)

Open the quickfix window if there were any errors, plus...

Super-handy mapping to jump to the given file, at the given line number (file under cursor)

---

Grunt documentation as helpfiles, from doc/*.markdown in grunt repository.

Todo: rewatch vim screencast on fugitive, trying to take inspiration, figure out what is possible to do.
