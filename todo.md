- generate vim helpfile from grunt doc markdown files
- add completion to `:Grunt`
- detect gruntfile and enable command based on that
- template/snippets for common grunt related file
  - `BufNewFile` grunt.{js|coffee}, gruntfile.{js|coffee}
  - `BufNewFile` */tasks/*
  - snippets/completion for some of the grunt api (file, util, log, etc.) autogenerated would be good.
